Some of my favorite typography resources. The absolute best are __bold__.

## Online
### Type Design
* [Typographer’s Glossary](https://playtype.com/about/typefaces/glossary)
* Games
    * [Shape Type](http://shape.method.ac), a letter shaping game
    * [Kern Type](http://type.method.ac), a kerning game

### Using Type
* __[Butterick’s Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com)__ is probably the best thing on this list—I find myself referring to it more than I’d care to admit.
* [Ask H&FJ: Four Ways to Mix Fonts](http://www.typography.com/email/2010_03/index.htm)
* [Erik Spiekermann’s Typo Tips](http://classic.fontshop.com/education/pdf/typo_tips.pdf) – Erik Spiekermann is more or less a legend in the type world.
* [Hack Design: Dive Into Typography](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/2)

### Making Fonts
* [So You Want to Create a Font](http://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/22/so-you-want-to-create-a-font-part-1/)
* A user over at Typophile compiled [this guide](http://typophile.com/node/12369) to creating fonts.
* Stephen Coles posted [this great response](http://www.quora.com/What-is-some-good-advice-for-aspiring-hobbyist-type-designers) on Quora.
* [Glyphs Mini](https://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini) is my tool of choice for tinkering with type design.

### Miscellaneous
* [I Love Typography](http://ilovetypography.com) posts interesting, historically-oriented pieces.
* Favorite Foundries
      * [Hoefler & Co.](http://www.typography.com): H&Co is more or less an industry standard at this point. They have particularly well designed type specimens, plus [Discover.typography](http://discover.typography.com) is amazing. Also, [this](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-08/font-war-inside-the-design-worlds-20-million-divorce)!
      * [Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz) is particularly great at display faces. My favorites are Tiempos, Pitch, and Founders Grotesk.
      * [Colophon Foundry](http://www.colophon-foundry.org/) has a distinct and offbeat style. [Aperçu](http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu/regular) is basically everywhere on the web nowadays.
* __[Fount](http://fount.artequalswork.com)__ is a bookmarklet I use all the time for identifying webfonts.
* [Type Sample](http://www.typesample.com) is a site I've just started using to collect webfonts I like.
* [Type Detail](http://typedetail.com) is a cool side project looking at the unique features of various typefaces.

## Offline
* [Just My Type](http://www.amazon.com/Just-My-Type-About-Fonts/dp/1592407463) is a fun, easy read.
* [Designing Type](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509) is one of the best resources for making a typeface, letter by letter.
