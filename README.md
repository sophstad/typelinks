# Typelinks
Some of my favorite typography resources.

## Online
### Type Design
* [Typographer’s Glossary](https://playtype.com/about/typefaces/glossary)
* Games
    * [Shape Type](http://shape.method.ac), a letter shaping game
    * [Kern Type](http://type.method.ac), a kerning game

### Using Type
* [Butterick’s Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com) (Probably the best thing on this list—I find myself referring to it more than I’d care to admit)
* [Ask H&FJ: Four Ways to Mix Fonts](http://www.typography.com/email/2010_03/index.htm)
* [Erik Spiekermann’s Typo Tips](http://classic.fontshop.com/education/pdf/typo_tips.pdf) (Erik Spiekermann is somewhat of a legend in the type world)
* [Hack Design: Dive Into Typography](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/2)

### Making Fonts
* [So You Want to Create a Font](http://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/22/so-you-want-to-create-a-font-part-1/)
* A user over at Typophile compiled [this guide](http://typophile.com/node/12369) to creating fonts.
* Stephen Coles posted [this great response](http://www.quora.com/What-is-some-good-advice-for-aspiring-hobbyist-type-designers) on Quora.

### Misc
* [I Love Typography](http://ilovetypography.com) posts super interesting, historically-oriented pieces.
* Favorite Foundries
      * [Hoefler & Co.](http://www.typography.com): H&Co is basically an industry standard at this point. They have particularly well designed type specimens.
      * [Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz) is particularly great at display faces. My favorites are Tiempos, Pitch, and Founders Grotesk.
      * [Colophon Foundry](http://www.colophon-foundry.org/) has a distinct and offbeat style. [Aperçu](http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu/regular) is basically everywhere on the web nowadays.
